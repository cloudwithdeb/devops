Azure AKS Networking Options
----------------------------

1. Kubenet
	I. POD CIDR address range is applied at cluster level
	II. Can Have different IP CIDR range

2. Azure CNI
	I. POD CIDR address range is applied at node pool level
	II. Cannot have different IP CIDR range

A. Dynamic
	I. POD CIDR address range is applied at node pool level
	II. Cannot have different IP CIDR range

B. Overlay
	I. POD CIDR address range is applied at cluster level
	II. Can have different IP CIDR range

AKS using Kubenete and Overlay network, pods get their IP address from a different cidr range. Hence
to enable communication between these pods a route table get creted with defined routes to enable
pod to pod communication in the same node or accross different nodes.

Note:
	Route table which get created and assigned to subnet can have
	a maximum of only 400 routes, Hence there can only be 400 node maximum
	in a particular node pool hence when using the kubenete or the overlay
	network plugin.
